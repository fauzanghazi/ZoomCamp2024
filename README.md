# ZoomCamp2024

There are three options to setup the environment which are:

1. Local Machine (macOS or Windows)
2. Google Cloud Platform
3. GitHub Codespaces

I tried setting it up on my Windows PC & laptop, both have challenges and I decided not to proceed as I still have 2 options to move forward.

My objective is to learn DE; thus, I'm not going to dive deep into the environment but sufficient to make my learning work.

However, I will learn the command line simultaneously as it is important in data engineering.

And setting the environment up, I did learn a lot too about how coding works and what attitude is important.

- Don't ask too early, solve it yourself first
- How to solve it? So many options, Google, StackOverflow, ChatGPT, CoPilot etc etc

As of now, I will continue with Codespaces first and will explore GCP later on.

My journey might be a little later, but I'm learning and will keep learning. üí™üèΩ
